    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>Kosher salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>3/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 cup Italian seasoned bread crumbs</li>
        <li>2 skinless, boneless chicken halves, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1/4 cup vegetable oil for frying</li>
        <li>1 lemon, cut into wedges</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C)</li>
        <li>
            Beat eggs with salt and pepper in a shallow dish. Spread flour in 
            another dish and bread crumbs in a third
        </li>
        <li>
            Working with one piece at a time, gently press chicken into flour to coat
            and shake off any excess, Dip into beaten eggs, then press into bread
            crumbs. Gently toss between your hands so excess bread crumbs can 
            fall away. Place breaded chicken onto a plate while breading the rest;
            do not stack
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Pan-fry chicken in 
            batches of 2 or 3 pieces until golden brown and no longerpink in the 
            center, 2 or 4 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted
            into the center should read at 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
            Transfer cooked chicken to a baking sheet and keep warm in the 
            preheated oven while cooking remaining chicken
        </li>
